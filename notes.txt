How could this app (server & client) be improved?
- Maybe extend the JWT expiration?
  - Complications: if we extend the JWT expiration, if anyone were to get ahold of this token, they'd have permissions/access
    for longer periods of time.
  - *Instructor note:* Instead of extending the JWT expiration (beyond 3-10mins) -> look into "Refresh Tokens"
  - Instead of authenticating using just a name (or similar), actually implement username + password authentication
    - *Instructor note:* DO NOT STORE THE PASSWORD AS PLAIN TEXT IN YOUR DB. Look into bcrypt (or Node's crypto package) and 
    get an understanding of how to hash and salt passwords. 
  - If you don't want to store the jwt token in state, look into other methods of storing it. 
    - research if local storage or session storage would be okay to use, if you determine it's not, research cookies.
- If a user tries to access a page, but they are not authenticated, are they presented with a message or some indicator as to why they
  were redirected?? 
- Maybe look into Public vs Protected routes with "react-router-dom" (you'll have to build these yourself)
- Are you able to update/use react-router-dom v6? :) 
- Add a GOOD README.md to your project!
- Is your application error/warning free when you deploy to prod? Seeing errors in the console on a production app is not ideal.
- If your heart so desires, how can you increase the security of your server? (look into a tool called Helmet)
- Make this into a PWA?
- Socket.io or Firebase for real-time data?
- Maybe implement a Redis cache?
- Payment APIs such as Stripe??
- Bottom line - what awesome tools or features can you implement to make this Capstone Project AWESOME?!?!?!

Bottom Bottom line, remember to HAVE FUN :D
